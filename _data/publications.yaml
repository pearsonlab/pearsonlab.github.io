  title: Neural support for contributions of utility and narrative processing of evidence
    in juror decision making
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience
  publisher: Society for Neuroscience
  page: 7624-7633
  volume: '42'
  issue: '40'
  abstract: Efforts to explain complex human decisions have focused on competing theories
    emphasizing utility and narrative mechanisms. These are difficult to distinguish
    using behavior alone. Both narrative and utility theories have been proposed to
    explain juror decisions, which are among the most consequential complex decisions
    made in a modern society. Here, we asked jury-eligible male and female subjects
    to rate the strength of a series of criminal cases while recording the resulting
    patterns of brain activation. We compared patterns of brain activation associated
    with evidence accumulation to patterns of brain activation derived from a large
    neuroimaging database to look for signatures of the cognitive processes associated
    with different models of juror decision-making. Evidence accumulation correlated
    with multiple narrative processes, including reading and recall. Of the cognitive
    processes traditionally viewed as components of utility, activation patterns associated
    with uncertainty, but not value, were more active with stronger evidence. Independent
    of utility and narrative, activations linked to reasoning and relational logic
    also correlated with increasing evidence. Hierarchical modeling of cognitive processes
    associated with evidence accumulation supported a more prominent role for narrative
    in weighing evidence in complex decisions. However, utility processes were also
    associated with evidence accumulation. These complementary findings support an
    emerging view that integrates utility and narrative processes in complex decisions.SIGNIFICANCE
    STATEMENT The last decade has seen a sharply increased interest in narrative as
    a central cognitive process in human decision-making and as an important factor
    in the evolution of human societies. However, the roles of narrative versus utility
    models of decision-making remain hotly debated. While available models frequently
    produce similar behavioral predictions, they rely on different cognitive processes
    and so their roles can be separated using the right neural tests. Here, we use
    brain imaging during mock juror decisions to show that cognitive processes associated
    with narrative, and to a lesser extent utility, were engaged while subjects evaluated
    evidence. These results are consistent with interactions between narrative and
    utility processes during complex decision-making.

  title: Scene statistics and noise determine the relative arrangement of receptive
    field mosaics
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  publisher: National Academy of Sciences
  volume: '118'
  issue: '39'
  abstract: 'Across a wide variety of species, cells in the retina specialized for
    signaling either increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in light represent one of the
    most basic building blocks of visual computation. These cells coordinate to form
    mosaics, with each cell responsible for a small, minimally overlapping portion
    of visual space, but the ways in which these mosaics could be spatially coordinated
    with each other are relatively unknown. Here, we show how efficient coding theory,
    which hypothesizes that the nervous system minimizes the amount of redundant information
    it encodes, can predict the relative spatial arrangement of ON and OFF mosaics.
    The most information-efficient arrangements are determined both by levels of noise
    in the system and the statistics of natural images.Many sensory systems utilize
    parallel ON and OFF pathways that signal stimulus increments and decrements, respectively.
    These pathways consist of ensembles or grids of ON and OFF detectors spanning
    sensory space. Yet, encoding by opponent pathways raises a question: How should
    grids of ON and OFF detectors be arranged to optimally encode natural stimuli?
    We investigated this question using a model of the retina guided by efficient
    coding theory. Specifically, we optimized spatial receptive fields and contrast
    response functions to encode natural images given noise and constrained firing
    rates. We find that the optimal arrangement of ON and OFF receptive fields exhibits
    a transition between aligned and antialigned grids. The preferred phase depends
    on detector noise and the statistical structure of the natural stimuli. These
    results reveal that noise and stimulus statistics produce qualitative shifts in
    neural coding strategies and provide theoretical predictions for the configuration
    of opponent pathways in the nervous system.There are no data underlying this work.'

  abstract: Neuroscientists now routinely record the activity of large numbers of
    neurons at high temporal and spatial resolution. With these capabilities comes
    the promise of causally intervening during these recordings by perturbing neurons
    or changing experimental conditions, requiring tight integration between data
    acquisition, analysis, and manipulation. Unfortunately, solutions for real-time
    interventions are rare, difficult to design and implement, and remain largely
    unused. Here, we introduce improv, a software platform that allows users to flexibly
    specify and manage adaptive experiments to integrate data collection, preprocessing,
    visualization, and user-defined analytics. Using improv for streaming data analysis
    for two photon calcium imaging and behavior we demonstrate how access to online
    information can be used for automated, integrated experimentation.Competing Interest

  abstract: 'While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains one of the
    most widespread and important methods in basic and clinical neuroscience, the
    data it produces—time series of brain volumes—continue to pose daunting analysis
    challenges. The current standard (“mass univariate”) approach involves constructing
    a matrix of task regressors, fitting a separate general linear model at each volume
    pixel (“voxel”), computing test statistics for each model, and correcting for
    false positives post hoc using bootstrap or other resampling methods. Despite
    its simplicity, this approach has enjoyed great success over the last two decades
    due to: 1) its ability to produce effect maps highlighting brain regions whose
    activity significantly correlates with a given variable of interest; and 2) its
    modeling of experimental effects as separable and thus easily interpretable. However,
    this approach suffers from several well-known drawbacks, namely: inaccurate assumptions
    of linearity and noise Gaussianity; a limited ability to capture individual effects
    and variability; and difficulties in performing proper statistical testing secondary
    to independently fitting voxels. In this work, we adopt a different approach,
    modeling entire volumes directly in a manner that increases model flexibility
    while preserving interpretability. Specifically, we use a generalized additive
    model (GAM) in which the effects of each regressor remain separable, the product
    of a spatial map produced by a variational autoencoder and a (potentially nonlinear)
    gain modeled by a covariate-specific Gaussian Process. The result is a model that
    yields group-level effect maps comparable or superior to the ones obtained with
    standard fMRI analysis software while also producing single-subject effect maps
    capturing individual differences. This suggests that generative models with a
    decomposable structure might offer a more flexible alternative for the analysis
    of task-based fMRI data.'

  title: 'Between heuristics and optimality: Flexible integration of cost and evidence
    during information sampling'
  title-short: Between heuristics and optimality
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
  abstract: Effective decision making in an uncertain world requires balancing the
    benefits of acquiring relevant information with the costs of delaying choice.
    Optimal strategies for information sampling can be accurate but computationally
    expensive, whereas heuristic strategies are often computationally simple but rigid.
    To characterize the computations that underlie information sampling, we examined
    choice processes in human participants who sampled sequences of images (e.g. indoor
    and outdoor scenes) and attempted to infer the majority category (e.g. indoor
    or outdoor) under two reward conditions. We examined how behavior maps onto potential
    information sampling strategies. We found that choices were best described by
    a flexible function that lay between optimality and heuristics; integrating the
    magnitude of evidence favoring each category and the number of samples collected
    thus far. Integration of these criteria resulted in a trade-off between evidence
    and samples collected, in which the strength of evidence needed to stop sampling
    decreased linearly as the number of samples accumulated over the course of a trial.
    This non-optimal trade-off best accounted for choice behavior even under high
    reward contexts. Our results demonstrate that unlike the optimal strategy, humans
    are performing simple accumulations instead of computing expected values, and
    that unlike a simple heuristic strategy, humans are dynamically integrating multiple
    sources of information in lieu of using only one source. This evidence-by-costs
    tradeoff illustrates a computationally efficient strategy that balances competing
    motivations for accuracy and cost minimization.Competing Interest StatementThe

  title: Encoding of odors by mammalian olfactory receptors
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
  abstract: Identified ligands for &gt; 500 mouse ORsORs are specifically tuned towards
    individual odorants and their molecular propertiesOdor molecular properties are
    informative of odor responsesPredictive modeling and convergent evolution analyses
    suggest specific residues within a canonical location for odorant bindingOlfactory
    receptors (ORs) constitute the largest multi-gene family in the mammalian genome,
    with hundreds to thousands of loci in humans and mice respectively1. The rapid
    expansion of this massive family of genes has been generated by numerous duplication
    and diversification events throughout evolutionary history. This size, similarity,
    and diversity has made it challenging to define the principles by which ORs encode
    olfactory stimuli. Here, we performed a broad surveying of OR responses, using
    an in vivo strategy, against a diverse panel of odorants. We then used the resulting
    interaction profiles to uncover relationships between OR responses, odorants,
    odor molecular properties, and OR sequences. Our data and analyses revealed that
    ORs generally exhibited sparse tuning towards odorants and their molecular properties.
    Odor molecular property similarity between pairs of odorants was informative of
    odor response similarity. Finally, ORs sharing response to an odorant possessed
    amino acids at poorly conserved sites that exhibited both, predictive power towards
    odorant selectivity and convergent evolution. The localization of these residues
    occurred primarily at the interface of the upper halves of the transmembrane domains,
    implying that canonical positions govern odor selectivity across ORs. Altogether,
    our results provide a basis for translating odorants into receptor neuron responses
    for the unraveling of mammalian odor coding.Competing Interest StatementHM has
