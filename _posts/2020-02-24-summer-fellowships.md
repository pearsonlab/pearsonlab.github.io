Members of the Pearson Lab have successfully obtained competitive positions for summer research programs this year!  Nicole Moiseyev was accepted into the Biomedical Big Data Science training program at Mt. Sinai in New York City, where she will tackle data-intensive biomedical problems with machine learning and data harmonization tools. Richard Sriworarat will be spending the summer at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus in Virginia as a part of their Undergraduate Scholars Program. He will work in the lab of Dr. Marius Pachitariu, where they use machine learning techniques to investigate the structure of neural activity recorded from tens of thousands of neurons simultaneously.
