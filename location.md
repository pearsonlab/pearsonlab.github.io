We're located in the [Bryan Research Building](https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=68). This is a view of it from across Research Drive:

If you walk toward the building from either side, you'll find the entrance inside the breezeway in the middle:

Inside the lobby, turn right and enter the department offices:

Head toward the back, where you'll find the Center for Theoretical Neurobiology. The lab and John's office are inside.
