## Update: As of November 2022, we are moving to the Bryan Research Building. Directions to be updated soon!

---------

We're located in the [Levine Science Research Center](http://maps.duke.edu/map/?id=21#!s/key=lsrc?m/6561). LSRC is big, making it easy to find, but perhaps not easy to find us specifically. Our lab's office number is C03C, which is in the basement level of the C-Wing. 

If you're coming from West Campus (Bryan Center, Chapel, etc.), first find the section of LSRC by the DIBS cube, that shiny glass box just off the large lawn.

Alternately, if you're coming from Erwin Road, Circuit, or Research Drive, this is the view of the entrance from the traffic circle:

and you should walk straight through until you see the DIBS glass cube in the first photo. Then, walk further down to this entrance (C-Wing):

Once inside, immediately go to the door on the right and take the stairs down to the basement.

Turn right once more and you'll see the entrance to the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN). This door is kept locked, so please knock to be let in.

Our office (C03C) is the first door on the right!
