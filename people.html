  University of Kentucky and his PhD in physics from Princeton. He became a
  neuroscientist at Duke, where he did his postdoctoral training with Michael
  Platt, working on the neurobiology of reward and decision-making. From 2015 to
  2018, he was an Assistant Research Professor in the Duke Institute for Brain
  Sciences. In 2018, he moved back to the School of Medicine as an Assistant
  Professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and in 2022, he moved to the 
  Department of Neurobiology. In addition, he maintains secondary
  appointments in the departments of Biostatics & Bioinformatics, Psychology & Neuroscience, and Electrical
  and Computer Engineering. (<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/jm0ftn246xqi3ne/john_pearson_cv.pdf?dl=0'>cv</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br />" %}

  His research interests include reproducible research practices and the
  application of probabilistic machine learning to understanding complex
  behavior, and he currently works on models for evidence integration in
  subjective legal judgements. His non-scientific activities include biking,
  reading Victorian novels with his wife, and attempting to appreciate jazz.
