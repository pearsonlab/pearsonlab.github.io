  University of Kentucky and his PhD in physics from Princeton. He became a
  neuroscientist at Duke, where he did his postdoctoral training with Michael
  Platt, working on the neurobiology of reward and decision-making. From 2015 to
  2018, he was an Assistant Research Professor in the Duke Institute for Brain
  Sciences. In 2018, he moved back to the School of Medicine as an Assistant
  Professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and in 2022, he moved to the
  Department of Neurobiology, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 2025. In addition, he maintains secondary
  appointments in the departments of Biostatics & Bioinformatics, Psychology & Neuroscience, and Electrical
  and Computer Engineering. (<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o05n1v0skl5el9w938oca/john_pearson_cv.pdf?rlkey=wickra8h33u8hfsr40l0jdhxf&st=8buq1yz2&dl=0'>cv</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br />" %}

  He entered Duke through the CNAP program. He currently develops and applies computational methods to
  understand the neural bases of natural learning. When not doing
  research, he loves getting outside and hiking or rock climbing - unless it's
  too cold, in which case you can find him indoors cooking or playing games.

He received his B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh. He is interested in building mathematical models to summarize, explain, and predict phenomena observed in brains. Currently, he is developing models to explain how songbirds learn to sing. He previously worked with Dr. Nicolas Brunel on the roles of inhibition and inhibitory plasticity in the learning and memory of sequences. Outside of the lab he loves cooking and exercising, and occasionally plays the xiao (Chinese flute).
