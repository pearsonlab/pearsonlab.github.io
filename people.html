  University of Kentucky and his PhD in physics from Princeton. He became a
  neuroscientist at Duke, where he did his postdoctoral training with Michael
  Platt, working on the neurobiology of reward and decision-making. From 2015 to
  2018, he was an Assistant Research Professor in the Duke Institute for Brain
  Sciences. In 2018, he moved back to the School of Medicine as an Assistant
  Professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and in 2022, he moved to the
  Department of Neurobiology. In addition, he maintains secondary
  appointments in the departments of Biostatics & Bioinformatics, Psychology & Neuroscience, and Electrical
  and Computer Engineering. (<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o05n1v0skl5el9w938oca/john_pearson_cv.pdf?rlkey=wickra8h33u8hfsr40l0jdhxf&st=8buq1yz2&dl=0'>cv</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br />" %}

  psychology and economics from New York University, Seth completed his PhD in
  Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania where he used computational
  methods to glean new insights into the social behavior of non-human primates.
  His research interests include reproducible research practices and the
  application of probabilistic machine learning to understanding complex
  behavior, and he currently works on models for evidence integration in
  subjective legal judgements. His non-scientific activities include biking,
  reading Victorian novels with his wife, and attempting to appreciate jazz.

  to Duke, she was a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the NIMH, where she
  worked on developing computational screening methods for genomic and imaging
  biomarkers of working memory deficits in schizophrenia. As a first year ECE
  graduate student at Duke, she is interested in applying statistical machine-learning
